# SoftStore
Soft Store Project is my pet project for Epam Upskill program.

<h1 align="center">The purpose of the application.</h1>
	My application will help people create their own personal stores of homemade toys and sell them. It allows buyers to conveniently search for toys and communicate with those they like in stores.
<h1 align="center">Basic scenario.</h1>
	The user goes to the site, selects the products they need, and puts them in their cart for further purchases.
<h1 align="center">Advanced scenario.</h1>

	Logs in under this account.
	Creates a new store.
	Creates toys and saves them in their store.
	Selects the toys they need from the Catalog and puts them in their cart for further purchases.
