# SoftStore
Soft Store Project is my pet project for Epam Upskill program.

<h3 align="center">The purpose of the application.</h3>
	My application will help people create their own personal stores of homemade toys and sell them. It allows buyers to conveniently search for toys and communicate with those they like in stores.
<h3 align="center">Basic scenario.</h3>
	The user goes to the site, selects the products they need, and puts them in their cart for further purchases.
